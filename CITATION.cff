abstract: >-
  UVRA defines the universe as a pre-calculated, immutable High-Dimensional Vector Database. 
  It provides a four-layer architecture (Schema, Engine, Runtime, Interface) to reframe 
  physical phenomena—such as light speed, gravity, and entropy—as fundamental 
  database operations and constraints.
